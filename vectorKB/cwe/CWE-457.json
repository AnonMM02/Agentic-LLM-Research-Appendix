    "title": "Use of Uninitialized Variable",
    "text": "Description: The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results. Extended Description: In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code. Consequences: Availability Integrity Other Other Initial variables usually contain junk, which can not be trusted for consistency. This can lead to denial of service conditions, or modify control flow in unexpected ways. In some cases, an attacker can \"pre-initialize\" the variable using previous actions, which might enable code execution. This can cause a race condition if a lock variable check passes when it should not. Authorization Other Other Strings that are not initialized are especially dangerous, since many functions expect a null at the end -- and only at the end -- of a string. Mitigations: Implementation Attack Surface Reduction Ensure that critical variables are initialized before first use [REF-1485].",

    "text": "Build and Compilation Compilation or Build Hardening Most compilers will complain about the use of uninitialized variables if warnings are turned on. Implementation Operation When using a language that does not require explicit declaration of variables, run or compile the software in a mode that reports undeclared or unknown variables. This may indicate the presence of a typographic error in the variable's name. Requirements Language Selection Choose a language that is not susceptible to these issues. Architecture and Design Mitigating technologies such as safe string libraries and container abstractions could be introduced. Detection Methods: Fuzzing Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues. High Automated Static Analysis Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.",
