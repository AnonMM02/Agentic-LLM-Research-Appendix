Consequences: Other Alter Execution Logic This weakness can cause unintended logic to be executed and other unexpected application behavior. Detection Methods: Automated Static Analysis This weakness can be found easily using static analysis. However in some cases an operator might appear to be incorrect, but is actually correct and reflects unusual logic within the program.
