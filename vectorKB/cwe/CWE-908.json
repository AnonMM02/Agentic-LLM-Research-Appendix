    "title": "Use of Uninitialized Resource",
    "text": "Description: The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized. Extended Description: When a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product. Consequences: Confidentiality Read Memory Read Application Data When reusing a resource such as memory or a program variable, the original contents of that resource may not be cleared before it is sent to an untrusted party. Availability DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart The uninitialized resource may contain values that cause program flow to change in ways that the programmer did not intend. Mitigations: Implementation Explicitly initialize the resource before use. If this is performed through an API function or standard procedure, follow all required steps. Implementation Pay close attention to complex conditionals that affect initialization, since some branches might not perform the initialization. Implementation Avoid race conditions (CWE-362) during initialization routines. Build and Compilation Run or compile the product with settings that generate warnings about uninitialized variables or data.",
