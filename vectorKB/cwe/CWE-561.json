    "title": "Dead Code",
    "text": "Description: The product contains dead code, which can never be executed. Extended Description: Dead code is code that can never be executed in a running program. The surrounding code makes it impossible for a section of code to ever be executed. Consequences: Other Quality Degradation Dead code that results from code that can never be executed is an indication of problems with the source code that needs to be fixed and is an indication of poor quality. Other Reduce Maintainability Mitigations: Implementation Remove dead code before deploying the application. Testing Use a static analysis tool to spot dead code.",
